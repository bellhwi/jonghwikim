        I used ReactJS on purpose for one of the features in the project. My
        client required a filter that showed the products without page

        I used Redux to optimize the data fetching logic. It lets me manage

        My goal is to become a full-stack developer ultimately. However I want
        to focus on the frontend for now. That's why I decided to use Firebase

        My specialty is programming and I'm looking for frontend web developer
        job. That's why I decided to focus more on developing rather than
